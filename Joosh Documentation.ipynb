    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This helper class `stepwise` can be used to automatically build linear regression models (both OLS and logistic) given a defined feature/target set and desired statistical checks (if any). For now, the implementation only includes simple forward or backwards selection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework here uses the `Patsy` implementation of `StatsModels` to build regression formulas similar to those used in R. It assumes:\n",
    " * Your data has already been numerically encoded (both target and features) into a `Pandas` dataframe.\n",
    " * The data doesn't produce a singular matrix (which causes many statsmodels regression models to fail).\n",
    " * The column names don't have any whitespace or invalid characters (see the Patsy docs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology is simple and always considers the p-value cutoff (as defined by the `pcutval` parameter) to determine whether or not to add/remove a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the class can also be asked to consider the following statistical checks by passing the names to the `checks` parameter as part of a list:\n",
    " * `AIC` - If the newer model (after addition/removal of a feature) has a higher AIC than the previous model, this check is marked as a failure\n",
    " * `BIC` - If the newer model (after addition/removal of a feature) has a higher BIC than the previous model, this check is marked as a failure\n",
    " * `R2` - If the newer model (after removal of a feature) has a lower R^2 than the previous model, this check is marked as a failure. Note that for logistic models, pseudo-R2 is used. This is not available for backwards selection since the R^2 will generally decrease.\n",
    " * `AdjR2` - If the newer model (after addition/removal of a feature) has a lower adjusted R^2 than the previous model, this check is marked as a failure. Note that for logistic models, a pseudo adjusted R^2 is not available.\n",
    " \n",
    "In the case of forward selection, if any statistical check fails, the feature will not be added even if the p-value for that feature met the cut value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of backwards selection, if any statistical check fails, the feature will not be removed even if the p-value for that feature did not meet the cut value. In practice, the feature that was previously removed (since it didn't meet the p-value cutoff) will be added back to the model and retain through future builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the overall search is defined by a simple ranking of pearson correlation coefficients with the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The full class build with default values is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`stepwise(data, target, features, method='forward', target_type='numerical', pcutval=0.05, checks=[]):`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "* `data` expects a pandas dataframe\n",
    "* `target` is the string name of the target feature in the dataframe\n",
    "* `features` expects a list of strings representing features in the dataframe\n",
    "* `method` can be either `forward` or `backward`\n",
    "* `target_type` can be either `numerical` (for OLS) or `categorical` (for logit)\n",
    "* `pcutval` defaults to 0.05, but set as needed\n",
    "* `checks` expects a list of strings noting the additional statistical checks to apply (as noted above). A p-value check will always be applied"
